## Welcome to Pocket

Fundamentals:
- Small transaction crypto
- For beginners or low income/gains investors
- Low gas fees
- Low tax rates (1%)
- Max input/output amounts (ie. no more than buying in $1000 per day / no more tahn taking out $500 per day) (limits need for high liquidity)
- Transaction Printing: Every transaction prints X number of tokens: to counteract inflation, pay small dividends on every print (ie. one transaction prints 100 new tokens, 50 of which are divided among the total number of holders evenly, the other 50 of which are put into an open pool, available for purchase)
- **Coins printed to pay gas fee so the fee is felt by everyone as inflation. Keeps price lower**
